    <h1 class="announcement-title">[ARIV O5] Activity Logging Technology</h1>
    <div class="announcement-meta">Created by Choppovm ‚Ä¢ 2025-08-15<br>This website is liable to change at any time; previous announcements here aren't able to be reviewed once removed</div>
    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 class="heading">Staff Activity Logging</h2>
    <p class="text">Heya big red roles. Before continuing (as to not waste your time), just want to state that if you aren't involved in:</p>
    <p class="text">- Server Start Up Hosts, </p>
    <p class="text">- Game Moderation Team, </p>
    <p class="text">- Acting Department, </p>
    <p class="text">- Morphing Department, </p>
    <p class="text">- Event Committee, </p>
    <p class="text">...then this first part of the announcement doesn't really apply to you, as it's for staff with primarily in-game purposes. Apologies. You can still read it if you want, but if you don't, just feel free to skip to the second part, as you'll be needed there.</p>
    <p class="text"><i>This could end up being a waste of time for me, but it is what it is üôè</i>. Also, forgive me using this website. Discord's character limit for announcements is just too large for me to make it all in one message, and I didn't want to have to announce it in two.</p>
    <p class="text"><br></p>
    <h3 class="subheading">Part 1: A website</h3>
    <p class="text">I've made a website to help staff log their in-game activity. Since this is department-wide, there isn't any specifics (like "players morphed", "warns/kicks/bans issued", "users modded", etcetera) <i>yet</i>.</p>
    <p class="text">I brought this idea up with OTA+ but didn't get an opinion from them. As such, I want to hear what you guys think of this. <b>Would you like your department to use this website to help log activity, or would you prefer to stick to a discord bot (e.g. Trident, ERM, etc)?</b></p>
    <p class="text">Additionally, once you've had a look through it, <b>let me know any features you want added to the website in terms of department-specific things</b>. For example, MD might want "players unmorphed", "players morphed", "players startergeared", etcetera, while Game Moderation might want "players warned", "players kicked", "players banned", etcetera.</p>
    <p class="text">Here's the website in question: <a href="https://choppovm.github.io/ariv_staff_activity_logger/">https://choppovm.github.io/ariv_staff_activity_logger/</a> (it's a GitHub pages site, so the source code is public (if there's classified department duties you don't want added to it, stick to using a discord-only logging method)).</p>
    <p class="text"><br></p>
    <h3 class="subheading">Part 2: Other Departments</h3>
    <p class="text">For the O5s that skipped to this second part, a small TL;DR of part 1: I made a website that helps staff log in-game activity and wanted their opinions on it, whether or not they'd use it or a discord bot instead, and what they wanted added in terms of department-specific things if they did want to use it.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm not gonna lie here, it feels a bit unfair leaving the other staff teams out on this (e.g. appeals team, faction management, discord moderation, etcetera).</p>
    <p class="text">As such, for the O5s and their respective staff departments not included in this website, let me know if you do want to be included. While I can't do things like store data or keep a database of things with the website (due to it being open-source), I can try and make something with it to help your department out (e.g. maybe for Discord Moderation, a panel for helping temporarily store screenshots against a rulebreaker).</p>
    <p class="text">Yeah ok I think that's basically all I have to say on the matter.</p>
    <p class="text"><br></p>
    <h3 class="subheading">Part 3: Short conclusion</h3>
    <p class="text">At the end of the day, <b>YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE THIS WEBSITE FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT.</b></p>
    <p class="text">This website only exists as an alternative to using Discord bots. <u>It is <b>NOT</b> mandatory to use this website.</u> It's your department, it's your choices.</p>
    <p class="text">If you do have any questions, or if you want me to update the website for your department (I'll be adding tabs if this is used), speak in the thread attached to the discord announcement.</p>
    <p class="text">Other than that, I have nothing more to say on this matter (if I do it'll be in the announcements channel this was posted in).</p>
    <p class="text"><br></p>
    <p class="text">Thanks for reading the yap session.</p>
